# Setup
1) This hooks the compilers wsopen_s api at runtime using my polyhook library. A (old, but known good) version of polyhook is included, you must build the capstone libs.
2) Build this project
3) Find you c1xx.dll in the visual studio installation directory. Use CFF explorer to add a new import address table entry for the dll built by this project
4) Copy the correct versions of the capstone dll and the dll from this into the same directory as your c1xx.dll
5) Make a new visual studio project and copy the .editorconfig file to the root. This forces VS to save your source files as UTF8
6) `#define ENC(x) x` where you want to use encrption, compile, and enjoy
